Computer Science and Mathematics Major at Frostburg State University

## About Me

Hello, my name is Dawson Hormuth. I am currently attending Frostburg State University where I am a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. Of my many repositories you can find many that demonstrate different skills. For example, my https://github.com/ddhormuth0/EmployeeTracking repository demonstrates my ability to use many Web Development skills like Javascript, React, Express, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It also displays my backend skills with SQL. In other projects like my finished project folder you can see many different applications that demonstrate my skills with javascript.
